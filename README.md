
# Courier API Task

## Task Division 

this taks is divided into 3 parts, the user's class (Client) ``` class client() ```, 
the Mediator class ``` class courierInterface ``` and the courier services classes to handle each courier
api functionality.

The work follows the following steps:

- Client has 2 functionalties as requested
- The client talks to the interface class that connects him with the required api 
- Each API is wrapped in a class, each one got its own functions however, they are all linked to the interface to execute the ```createShipment()``` and ```trackShipment()```.

I used the SOLID princples.
